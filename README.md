 ![CALMS Model ](https://www.devopsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/devopsgroup_blog_CALMS_model.jpg)

 CALMS is an abbreviation to the 5 concepts:
 - **C**ulture
 - **A**utomation
 - **L**ean
 - **M**easurement
 - **S**haring
 
 It is a framework that is often used in the context of DevOps to guide organizations through the process of adopting DevOps practices. Let's understand what these 5 components actually do and why we can benefit from it.

## Culture
Culture refers to *the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes* that shape the way that people in an organization work and interact with one another. Culture is a critical component of any organization/workplace, as it can impact everything from *employee satisfaction and engagement to the success of the business.*

Workplaces and organizations are meant to strive to create a psychological safe environment, where people aren't afraid of bringing their full self to work, and bad news are learning opportunities, rather than a reason for scolding. 

In the context of DevOps, culture is particularly important, as it can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of DevOps practices. A culture that *values collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement is essential for success in DevOps*, as it can help to break down silos and promote innovation and agility.

### Here are some key aspects of culture in the context of DevOps:

- **Collaboration:** A culture of collaboration is essential for success in DevOps, as it helps to break down silos between departments and teams and *promotes better communication and knowledge sharing*. This can lead to better outcomes and more innovative solutions.

- **Transparency:** A culture of transparency is important in DevOps, as it helps to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of the goals, processes, and progress of the organization. This can help to *build trust* and improve communication and collaboration.

- **Continuous Improvement:** A culture of continuous improvement is essential in DevOps, as it *helps to promote a mindset of learning and experimentation*. By continuously reviewing and refining processes, organizations can identify areas for improvement and make incremental changes over time.

- **Risk-taking:** A culture that encourages risk-taking and experimentation is important in DevOps, as it can help to *foster innovation and agility*. By taking calculated risks and *** embracing failure as a learning opportunity***, organizations can become more adaptable and better equipped to respond to changing business needs.

- **Leadership:** Leadership is a critical component of culture in DevOps, *as leaders set the tone* for the organization and model the behavior that they want to see in others. By demonstrating a commitment to collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, *leaders can help to create a culture that supports the principles of DevOps*.

Overall, by promoting a culture of collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, organizations and workplaces can create an environment that supports the principles of DevOps and enables them to respond quickly and effectively to changing business needs.
