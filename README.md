  <img src="https://www.devopsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/devopsgroup_blog_CALMS_model.jpg" alt= "CALMS Model" width= "50%" height = "50%">

 CALMS is an abbreviation to the 5 concepts:
 - **C**ulture
 - **A**utomation
 - **L**ean
 - **M**easurement
 - **S**haring
 
 It is a framework that is often used in the context of DevOps to guide workplaces through the process of adopting DevOps practices. Let's understand what these 5 components actually do and why we can benefit from it.


## Culture

Culture refers to *the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes* that shape the way that people in a business work and interact with one another. Culture is a critical component of any organization/workplace, as it can impact everything from *employee satisfaction and engagement to the success of the business.*

Workplaces and organizations are meant to strive to create a psychological safe environment, where people aren't afraid of bringing their full self to work, and bad news are learning opportunities, rather than a reason for scolding. 

In the context of DevOps, culture is particularly important, as it can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of DevOps practices. A culture that *values collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement is essential for success in DevOps*, as it can help to break down silos and promote innovation and agility.

### Key aspects of culture in the context of DevOps:

- **Collaboration:** A culture of collaboration is essential for success in DevOps, as it helps to break down silos between departments and teams and *promotes better communication and knowledge sharing*. This can lead to better outcomes and more innovative solutions.

- **Transparency:** A culture of transparency is important in DevOps, as it helps to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of the goals, processes, and progress of the organization. This can help to *build trust* and improve communication and collaboration.

- **Continuous Improvement:** A culture of continuous improvement is essential in DevOps, as it *helps to promote a mindset of learning and experimentation*. By continuously reviewing and refining processes, workplaces can identify areas for improvement and make incremental changes over time.

- **Risk-taking:** A culture that encourages risk-taking and experimentation is important in DevOps, as it can help to *foster innovation and agility*. By taking calculated risks and *** embracing failure as a learning opportunity***, workplaces can become more adaptable and better equipped to respond to changing business needs.

- **Leadership:** Leadership is a critical component of culture in DevOps, *as leaders set the tone* for the business and model the behavior that they want to see in others. By demonstrating a commitment to collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, *leaders can help to create a culture that supports the principles of DevOps*.

Overall, by promoting a culture of collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, workplaces can create an environment that supports the principles of DevOps and enables them to respond quickly and effectively to changing business needs.

## Automation

Automation refers to the use of technology and software to automate routine tasks and processes, freeing up time and resources for more strategic work. Following DevOps, automation is a critical component of success, as it can help to improve efficiency, reduce errors and downtime, and enable organizations to respond quickly and effectively to changing business needs.

Automation is becoming *increasingly important in modern IT environments*, where the speed of business is accelerating and the volume of data and applications is growing rapidly. By automating repetitive tasks, organizations can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and free up IT staff to focus on more strategic tasks that require human skills and expertise.

### Automations essential elements in the context of DevOps:


- **Continuous Integration and Deployment:** Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are two key automation techniques used in DevOps. CI involves automatically building and testing code changes as they are submitted, while CD involves automatically deploying those changes to production. These techniques help to ensure *that code changes are thoroughly tested and integrated into the system quickly and reliably.*

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a technique that involves using code to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure. By defining infrastructure as code, workplaces can easily and consistently provision and manage infrastructure, reducing the risk of configuration errors and ensuring that infrastructure is always up-to-date and consistent.

- **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Automation is also critical for testing and quality assurance in DevOps. Automated testing tools and techniques can help to quickly and reliably *test code changes, identify issues, and ensure that quality standards are met.* This can help to improve the quality of the software while reducing the time and resources required for manual testing.

- **Incident Response:** Automation is also important for incident response in DevOps. By automating incident response processes, organizations can quickly and efficiently respond to incidents, reducing downtime and minimizing the impact on the business.


### The good & bad about Automation

### The good things:

- **Increased efficiency:** Automation reduces the time and effort required to complete routine IT tasks, freeing up IT staff to focus on more important work.

- **Consistency:** Automated processes are less prone to error and variability, ensuring that IT tasks are completed consistently and accurately.

- **Scalability:** It makes it easier to scale IT operations, by allowing IT staff to manage more infrastructure, applications, and data with less effort.

- **Cost savings:** Automation can reduce the need for manual labor, resulting in cost savings for organizations.

- **Improved security:** Automated processes can help organizations to enforce security policies and ensure that systems are properly configured.

### The bad things:

- **Complexity:** Implementing automation can be a complex process that requires significant time and effort to design and implement.

- **Resistance to change:** Some IT staff may be resistant to the idea of automation, *fearing* that it will lead to job loss or a reduction in the importance of their role.

- **Dependence on technology:** It requires reliable and robust technology, and any failures or issues with the automation tools can have a significant impact on the business.

- **Lack of flexibility:** Automated processes may not be able to handle certain edge cases or unexpected scenarios, and *IT staff may need to manually intervene in these cases.*

- **Security risks:** If automation tools are not properly secured, they can *become a target for cyberattacks*, putting the business' IT infrastructure at risk.

Although there is as many bad as there is good things, automation isn't that bad, it's only for the better. Even though many people are worried that it may have an impact on their jobs and educations, the world would still need us. Automation has to be done by some people and the automation has to stay in maintenance, and there would still be job opportunities, maybe even more in the Tech educations than before. Automation success isn't about the tools but the people and the process, its more than just infrastructure and application automation. 


## Lean

Lean is a management philosophy and methodology that aims to maximize value while minimizing waste in the organization. Originally developed in the manufacturing industry, Lean has since been applied to a wide range of industries, including software development and IT operations.

### Primary factors of Lean:

- **Value:** Lean places a strong emphasis on understanding and delivering value to the customer. This involves identifying what the customer wants and needs and focusing efforts on delivering that value.

- **Value Stream Mapping:** Value Stream Mapping is a technique used in Lean to visualize the flow of work through the business. By mapping out the steps involved in delivering value to the customer, business' can identify opportunities to eliminate waste and improve efficiency.

- **Waste Reduction:** One of the key principles of Lean is the elimination of waste. This includes any activity that does not add value to the customer, such as overproduction, waiting, excess inventory, unnecessary processing, defects, and unused talent, and we'll look closer at these types of waste. By reducing waste, organizations can improve efficiency and reduce costs. 

- **Continuous Improvement:** Lean also places a strong emphasis on continuous improvement. This involves regularly reviewing processes and making incremental changes to improve efficiency and quality. By embracing a culture of continuous improvement, workplaces can stay agile and respond quickly to changing business needs.

- **Respect for People:** Finally, Lean emphasizes the importance of respect for people. This includes both employees and customers. By treating people with respect, workplaces can create a positive and collaborative work environment that promotes creativity and innovation.

When we talk about lean, it is typically about waste and there are 8 types of waste: defects, overproduction, waiting, non-utilized talents, transportation, inventory, motion and extra processing. Vertically it spells DOWNTIME. 

 <img src="https://agilemercurial.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/downtime.png" alt= "Downtime img" width= "30%" height = "30%">

One of the key goals of Lean is to minimize downtime and maximize value-added time. This involves identifying the root causes of downtime and implementing strategies to reduce or eliminate them. Some common strategies for reducing downtime in Lean include:

Improving equipment reliability: By improving the reliability of equipment and minimizing breakdowns, business' can reduce unplanned downtime and improve efficiency.

Implementing preventive maintenance: Regular preventive maintenance can help to prevent breakdowns and *prolong the life of equipment, reducing downtime and improving overall efficiency.*

Reducing changeover times: Changeovers, *or the time required to switch from one product to another,* can be a major source of downtime. By implementing strategies to reduce changeover times, such as standardizing processes and using quick-change tooling, organizations can reduce downtime and improve efficiency.

Streamlining processes: By identifying and eliminating non-value-added activities, such as *unnecessary steps or redundant processes,* workplaces can improve efficiency and reduce downtime.

Improving communication and information flow: **Waiting** for information or materials can be a major source of downtime. By improving communication and information flow, workplace can reduce waiting times and improve efficiency.

By minimizing downtime and maximizing value-added time, workplaces can *improve efficiency, reduce costs, and deliver greater value to the customer.*

## Measurement

In addition of the CALMS model in DevOps, measurement refers to the process of *collecting and analyzing data* in order to understand how the system is performing and identify opportunities for improvement. Measurement is a key aspect of the model, as it provides the data necessary to make informed decisions and track progress towards goals.

### Primary factors of Measurement:

- **Defining metrics:** Before measurements can be taken, it is important to identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be tracked. These metrics should be relevant to the goals of the organization and provide a clear picture of how well the system is performing.

- **Collecting data:** Once the metrics have been identified, data must be collected in order to track performance. This may involve using automated tools to collect data on system performance, as well as manual data collection through surveys, feedback, and other methods.

- **Analyzing data:** Once data has been collected, it must be analyzed in order to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. This may involve using data visualization tools, statistical analysis, and other techniques to make sense of the data.

- **Communicating results:** Finally, the results of the measurement process must be communicated to stakeholders in order to inform decision-making and track progress towards goals. This may involve creating reports, dashboards, and other tools to communicate data in a clear and meaningful way.


By implementing a robust measurement process, workplaces can gain a better understanding of how the system is performing, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions that drive continuous improvement. 



## Sharing

Sharing refers to the process of creating a collaborative culture in which teams work together and share knowledge, skills, and tools to achieve common goals. Sharing is a key aspect of the model, as it helps to break down silos and promote cross-functional collaboration. Sharing is the feedback and feedfoward to learn form others' knowledge. 

In order for sharing to be effective, there must be a *culture of trust and respect* among team members. This involves creating an environment in which people feel comfortable sharing their ideas and expertise without fear of judgement or retribution. It requires collaboration between different teams and individuals. This may involve creating cross-functional teams or holding regular meetings and workshops to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Sharing also requires transparency, both in terms of the data and information that is shared, and the decision-making processes that are used. This may involve creating *shared* dashboards or other tools that make data and information *easily accessible* to all team members.

Sharing is not just about sharing existing knowledge and tools, but also about fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. This involves encouraging experimentation, sharing failures and successes, and creating opportunities for professional development and training.

By creating a culture of sharing, workplaces can break down silos, improve communication and collaboration, and promote continuous improvement. This can help to create a more agile and responsive business that is better equipped to meet the changing needs of the market.
